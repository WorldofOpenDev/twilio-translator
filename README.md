## Twilio Translator

A Twilio service that translates back an SMS message. It also calls you back with a pronunciation in the local language. Useful if you're traveling - especially in occasions where your telco signal is a better option than wifi. Uses node.js and Mashape APIs (language detection, language translation, and text-to-voice)

### Try the service

Send an SMS message to +1 (415) 992-9984, "Take me to the bar ES".  The "ES" stands for Spanish.  You can try other languages such as "DE", "IT", etc.
You can also try a non-English message like "Hola mundo en".  Enjoy!
