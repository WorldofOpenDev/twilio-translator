## Twilio Translator

A Twilio service that translates back an SMS message. It also calls you back with a pronunciation in the local language. Useful if you're traveling - especially in occasions where your telco signal is a better option than wifi. Uses node.js and Mashape APIs (language detection, language translation, and text-to-voice)
